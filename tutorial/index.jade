      ## Warm Trasnfer
      ![Warm Transfer](//howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/warm-transfers.png)

      Have you ever been disconnected from a support call while been transfered to 
      somone else?
      
      Warm transfer eliminates this problem. Using this Twilio powered 
      application you can connect with a support agent which will have the ability 
      to dial someone else in before dropping the call.
      
      Here is how it works at a high level:
      
      1. The first agent becomes available when he/she connects through the web client.
      
      1. The second agent also becomes available when he/she connects through the web client.

      1. A client calls our support line.
      
      1. The client stays on hold while the first joins the call.
      
      1. While the first agent is on the phone with the client, he/she can dial a second agent into the call.
      
      1. Once the second agent is on the call, the first one can disconect from it.
      The client and the second agent stay on the call.

      Let's get started!

      ## Setting Up Voice Web Hook
      
      You will need to configure the voice webhook of the Twilio number that clients
      will call when they want to talk to a support agent.
      ![Configure Voice](//howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/twilio-number-config-all-med.gif)
      
      You need to expose your localhost using a tool like [ngrok](//ngrok.com/).
      Now your voice URL should look something like this:
      
      ```
      https://<subdomain>.ngrok.io/conference/connect/client
      ```
      
      **Note:** It is importantthat you use the `https` protocol because otherwise,
      your browser won't allow you to use your mic.

      ## Handling Incoming Calls From Clients
      
      When a client makes a call to our Twilio number we receive a POST request 
      asking for instructions. We'll use TwiML to instruct the client to join a
      conference room and the Twilio REST API client to start a call to
      the first agent, so he can join the same conference.
      
      We use the client's `CallSid` as the conference identifier all the participants
      require to join the conference room. That's why this identifier is stored in a
      database. This way the conference identifier can be used later to dial the second
      agent in.

      ## Providing TwiML Instruction For The Client
      
      We create a `TwiMLResponse` that will contain a
      [`Dial`](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/dial) verb with a
      [`Conference`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/conference) noun that
      will instruct the client to connect to a specific conference room.

      ## Dial First Agent Into the Call
      
      We'll use Twilio REST API client to create a new call. The `create` method
      receives a hash with the following keys:
      
      1. `from`: 
      
      1. `to`  : 
      
      1. `url` :
